		I’ve worked across just about every role in a tech organization—engineering, product, UX/UI, database, analytics, Ops, sales, customer liason. I know how systems work, and I know how people work together (or don’t) to make them useful.

		The main thing I’ve learned is that the hardest part isn’t the skills within each group—it’s the communication between them. Making sense across boundaries. That’s also what makes AI interesting: as a partner, it’s only as useful as the context you bring and the questions you ask.

		I’m putting this out now not because it’s done, but because it’s helping me think more clearly—and maybe it can help someone else too. It’s a tool, but it’s also a way of asking better questions and noticing what matters. I’ll be learning out loud as I go.
